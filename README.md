# rain-alert-project
This Python script checks weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API and sends SMS alerts via Twilio if rain is expected. It fetches weather data for a specified location, checks for rain, and sends an SMS reminder to bring an umbrella. It uses environment variables for API keys and includes error handling for robust operation.
